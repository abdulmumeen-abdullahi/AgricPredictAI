Agriculture remains the backbone of food security, yet millions of farmers, especially in developing regions, struggle with unpredictable weather, crop diseases, poor soil health, and limited access to expert advice. <br/>
As an aspiring AI/ML Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems, I built FarmConsultAI to tackle these critical agricultural challenges using the power of Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Overview
FarmConsultAI is an intelligent, AI-powered assistant designed to help farmers, agropreneurs, and agri-investors make smarter, faster, and more informed farming decisions. <br/>

**This project integrates**:

- A Random Forest Regressor Machine Learning model that predicts crop yield based on land, weather, and input parameters.
- An EfficientNet-B3 Computer Vision model that detects and classifies diseases from uploaded crop images.
- A Gemini-powered recommendation system that generates actionable, easy-to-understand advice in real time.
- A Streamlit-based web app for user-friendly, interactive access anytime, anywhere.

### With FarmConsultAI, Farmers Can:
 
+ **Input crop type, along with land and weather conditions to predict potential yield**

</p>

+ **Receive personalized, crop-specific advice based on soil and weather data** <br/>
+ **Access AI-powered insights for 5 major crops: Corn, Potato, Rice, Sugarcane, and Wheat** <br/>
+ **Chat with a virtual farm consultant, who explains insights and guidance in simple, local-friendly terms** <br/>
+ **Understand yield risks caused by poor nutrients or environmental conditions** <br/>
+ **Learn and actâ€”not just reactâ€”through expert-backed, explainable recommendations** <br/>

## Impact & Relevance
FarmConsultAI is aligned with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

- SDG 1 â€“ No Poverty: By improving farm productivity and reducing losses
- SDG 2 â€“ Zero Hunger: Helping farmers grow more, waste less, and feed communities
- SDG 13 â€“ Climate Action: Promoting climate-smart agriculture through informed decision-making <br/>
Whether youâ€™re a smallholder farmer in Kaduna, an agri-entrepreneur in Abia, or a student learning agriculture in Ibadan, FarmConsultAI brings expert knowledge and digital tools right to your fingertips.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch & TIMM â€“ Model training & image classification
- Streamlit â€“ for web-based deployment
- Gemini (Google Generative AI) â€“ for interactive recommendation engine
- Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn â€“ for yield prediction modeling

## What I Learned
- How to build effective Machine Learning and Computer Vision models for real-world problems
- How to deploy AI models using Streamlit to create interactive, user-friendly web applications
- How to integrate Gemini (Generative AI) to deliver personalized recommendations and conversational interactions

## Why This Matters
In Nigeria and many other developing countries, farmers often lack access to agronomic expertise or accurate data. FarmConsultAI bridges this gap by providing instant access to AI-driven insights that were once out of reach. <br/>
This is not just an app. Itâ€™s a step toward a more resilient, productive, and inclusive future for agriculture, starting in Nigeria, and expanding globally.
